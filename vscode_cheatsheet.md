## prefix multiple line with multi-cursor

I needed to copy large text into doc comments.  
It means every line must get a prefix like `///`.  
In VSCode I selected the text, press  
`alt+shift+i`
Now I have `multiple cursors` on the end of every selected line.  
I press the key
`home`
And now I have multiple cursors at the beginning of every line.  
I type (insert):
`///`  
and it's done! Great!
