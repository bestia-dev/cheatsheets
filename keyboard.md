# Keyboard cheatsheet

## Home, End on Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5

My laptop does not have dedicated keys for Home and End. That keys are very important to me while coding.
But it has Insert and PrtSc in ruffly the position of Home and End, that I am used to from Thinkpad.
Then it has two keys I never, never used. I could remap them to Insert and PrtSc.
I used Microsoff PowerToys to remap some keys:

Insert -> Home
PrtSc -> End

The key left of "1" -> Insert
The key left of "Y" -> PrtSc
